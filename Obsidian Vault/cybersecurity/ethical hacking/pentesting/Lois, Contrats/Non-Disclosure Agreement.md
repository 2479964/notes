NDA

Un NDA est un contrat qui permette aux partie qui font une entente de ne rien divulgu√© sur les informations obtenue par l'entremise de la collaboration.

La rupture d'un NDA n'est pas du tout recommander, poursuite et perte de confiance s'en suive.

Quelques types de NDA (EN):

- **Unilateral**: With a unilateral NDA, only one party discloses certain information to the other party, and the information must be kept protected and not disclosed. For example, an organization that hires you should include in an NDA certain information that you should not disclose. Of course, all of your findings must be kept secret and should not be disclosed to any other organization or individual.

- **Bilateral**: A bilateral NDA is also referred to as a mutual, or two-way, NDA. In a bilateral NDA, both parties share sensitive information with each other, and this information should not be disclosed to any other entity.

- **Multilateral**: This type of NDA involves three or more parties, with at least one of the parties disclosing sensitive information that should not be disclosed to any entity outside the agreement. Multilateral NDAs are used in the event that an organization external to your customer (business partner, service provider, and so on) should also be engaged in the penetration testing engagement.
