"In order to have a strong cybersecurity program, you need to ensure that business objectives take into account risk tolerance and that the resulting policies are enforced and adopted.

_Risk tolerance_ is how much of an undesirable outcome a risk-taker is willing to accept in exchange for the potential benefit. Inherently, risk is neither good nor bad. All human activity carries some risk, although the amount varies greatly. Consider this: Every time you get in a car, you are risking injury or even death. You manage the risk by keeping your car in good working order, wearing a seatbelt, obeying the rules of the road, avoiding texting while driving, driving only when not impaired, and paying attention. You tolerate the risks because the reward for reaching your destination outweighs the potential harm.

Risk-taking can be beneficial and is often necessary for advancement. For example, entrepreneurial risk-taking can pay off in innovation and progress. Ceasing to take risks would quickly wipe out experimentation, innovation, challenge, excitement, and motivation. Risk-taking can, however, be detrimental when it is influenced by ignorance, ideology, dysfunction, greed, or revenge. The key is to balance risk against rewards by making informed decisions and then managing the risk while keeping in mind organizational objectives. The process of managing risk requires organizations to assign risk management responsibilities, determine the organizational risk appetite and tolerance, adopt a standard methodology for assessing risk, respond to risk levels, and monitor risk on an ongoing basis.

_Risk management_ is the process of determining an acceptable level of risk (risk appetite and tolerance), calculating the current level of risk (risk assessment), accepting the level of risk (risk acceptance), or taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level (risk mitigation). Risk acceptance indicates that the organization is willing to accept the level of risk associated with a given activity or process. Generally, but not always, this means that the outcome of the risk assessment is within tolerance. There might be times when the risk level is not within tolerance, but the organization will still choose to accept the risk because all other alternatives are unacceptable. Exceptions should always be brought to the attention of management and authorized by either the executive management or the board of directors.""
